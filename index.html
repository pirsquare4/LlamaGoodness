        <h2>Such a beautiful boy</h2>
        <p>A llama has a long neck and thick eyelashes, and looks kind of like a camel without a hump. Llamas are native to South America, but experts believe they originated in the plains of North America about 40 million years ago, eventually becoming extinct in that part of the world, at least in the wild.</p>

        <h2>He is so happy to be alive </h2>
        <p>Llama, (Lama glama), South American member of the camel family, Camelidae (order Artiodactyla), closely related to the alpaca, guanaco, and vicu√±a, which are known collectively as lamoids. Unlike camels, lamoids do not have the characteristic camel humps; they are slender-bodied animals and have long legs and necks, short tails, small heads, and large, pointed ears. Gregarious animals, they graze on grass and other plants. When annoyed, they spit. Lamoids are able to interbreed and to produce fertile offspring.</p>
